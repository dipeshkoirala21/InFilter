# InFilter: Advanced Job Filter for LinkedIn

![InFilter Logo](icons/icon128.png)

**Supercharge your LinkedIn job search with precise time filters and a powerful company blocker.**

LinkedIn's default search only allows filtering jobs posted in the "Past 24 hours," making it hard to find the very latest opportunities. InFilter is a lightweight but powerful browser extension that breaks this limitation, giving you precise control over your job search. It seamlessly integrates into the LinkedIn UI, allowing you to filter job postings by any hour (1-23) and hide job listings from companies you're not interested in.

## Key Features

-   **ðŸŽ¯ Custom Hourly Time Filters:** Break free from LinkedIn's default "Past 24 hours" filter. Find the freshest job listings by filtering down to the exact hour.
-   **ðŸš« Powerful Company Blocker:** Clean up your search results by adding unwanted companies to a personal blocklist. InFilter will automatically hide jobs from these companies across LinkedIn.
-   **âœ¨ Seamless UI Integration:** InFilter feels like a native part of LinkedIn. Custom time filters and blocked companies are reflected directly on the search results page.
-   **ðŸ”’ Privacy-Focused & Stateless:** Your privacy is paramount. InFilter runs entirely locally in your browser. It **does not collect, store, or transmit any user data**. The time filter is stateless, meaning it reads the current URL to set its state, not from stored settings.
-   **ðŸ§  Smart & Persistent UI:** The popup remembers the last tab you used (Time Filter or Company Blocker) for a faster workflow.
